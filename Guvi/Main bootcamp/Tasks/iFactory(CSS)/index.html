                focusing on block style information architecture, you can create <br>
            refreshing and engaging visuals such as animations or beautiful <br>
        photography, that act as a continuum, ultimately inspiring users to <br>

                now less about clicking and more about scrolling, swiping and tapping. <br>
            Long-scrolling websites take away the barrier of complex navigation, <br>
        providing a responsive, user-friendly experience for mobile users.</p>

                    Parallax website design is a great solution for us time-poor <br>
                    website browsers, as it forces businesses to convey their <br>
                    message and vision into one dynamic web design page.

                <p>
                    These days, scrolling is so simple that it's become an <br>
                    instinctive action, whereas clicking through to another page <br>
                    requires thought and motivation. A single page website <br>
                    allows user to identify their purpose on the website quicker, <br>
                    than needing to sift through multiple pages.

            <div class="content4">
                <p>One of the biggest problems that parallax websites face is that <br>
                    they are not SEO friendly. Why? When you limit the number of <br>
                    pages on your website, Google has fewer pages to index and <br>
                    negatively impacts your standing on the search engine results <br>
                    page (SERP). Luckily there are ways around this.</p>

                <p>
                    50% of website users bounce off the page if it hasn’t loaded in 3-5 seconds. So the <br>
                    more high resolution imagery and animations you include, the longer it takes to <br>
                    load the page. When writing this article, we tested some popular parallax <br>
                    websites, and found that the ones with complex visuals took up to 30 seconds to <br>
                    load on a mobile device, whereas simple and minimalist long-scroll websites <br>
                    loaded within a few seconds.

                    Instead of hitting the “back” button, users must scroll back <br>
                    up the page which can be frustrating for users who want to <br>
                    refer back to a certain element. An easy way around this is <br>
                    to include top navigation and have each element anchored <br>
                    to a category or section.
